## Referencing

The Glue42 JavaScript library is available as a single JavaScript file, which you can include in your apps. If you are using a Glue42 installer, you can find the JavaScript files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tick42\GlueSDK\GlueJS\js`. When deploying your app in production, it is recommended to always reference a specific minified version:

```javascript
import Glue from "../scripts/desktop.umd.min.js";
```

The Glue42 JavaScript library is also available as an NPM package, which you can include as a dependency in your project and import in your code. The currently available packages are [`@glue42/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/core) and [`@glue42/desktop`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/desktop). The Core package is a subset of the Desktop package and offers basic functionalities for sharing data between apps ([Interop](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/interop/overview/index.html), [Shared Contexts](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/shared-contexts/overview/index.html), [Pub/Sub](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/pub-sub/overview/index.html), [Metrics](../../../../glue42-concepts/metrics/overview/index.html)), while the Desktop package offers additional options for sharing data between apps ([Channels](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/channels/overview/index.html)), as well as advanced window management functionalities ([App Management](../../../../glue42-concepts/application-management/overview/index.html), [Layouts](../../../../glue42-concepts/windows/layouts/overview/index.html), [Window Management](../../../../glue42-concepts/windows/window-management/overview/index.html)).

To include any of the packages as a dependency in your project, navigate to the root directory of your project and run:

```cmd
npm install @glue42/desktop
```

To reference the Glue42 library:

```javascript
import Glue from "@glue42/desktop";
```

## Initialization

If your Node.js app is started by [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/), you can initialize the Glue42 library without passing a configuration object to the factory function:

```javascript
import Glue from "@glue42/desktop";

// No configuration object.
const glue = await Glue().catch(console.error);

console.log(glue.version);
```

<!-- If your Node.js script is started outside [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/), you have to pass a configuration object when initializing Glue42:

```javascript
const Glue = require("@glue42/desktop");

const config = {
    application: "MyNodeApp",
    layouts: false,
    appManager: "full",
    logger: false,
    windows: false,
    gateway: {
        protocolVersion: 3,
        ws: process.env.gwURL
    },
    auth: {
        gatewayToken: process.env.gwToken
    }
};

// With configuration object.
const glue = await Glue(config).catch(console.error);

console.log(glue.version);
``` -->

## App Configuration

To add your Node.js app to the [Glue42 Toolbar](../../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-toolbar/index.html), you must create a JSON file with app configuration. Place this file in the `%LocalAppData%\Tick42\UserData\<ENV>-<REG>\apps` folder, where `<ENV>-<REG>` must be replaced with the environment and region of your [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) copy (e.g., `T42-DEMO`).

The following is an example configuration for a Node.js app:

```json
{
    "name": "node-server",
    "type": "node",
    "service": true,
    "details": {
        "path": "%GDDIR%/PathToMyServer/index.js",
        "showConsole": true
    }
}
```

The `"name"`, `"type"` and `"path"` properties are required and `"type"` must be set to `"node"`. The `"path"` property points to a JavaScript file that [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) will execute in a Node.js environment.
