## Glue42 Desktop

*Release date: 27.10.2021*

<glue42 name="addClass" class="breakingChanges" element="p" text="Breaking Changes">

Due to updating [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) to Electron 13 and Chromium 91, and increasing product security, clients which have implemented custom [splash screens](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-platform-features/index.html#splash_screen) or custom loaders must edit the splash/loader code as shown in the following example, in order for the custom splash screens and custom loaders to continue working properly:

```javascript
// Delete this constant declaration from the splash/loader code.
const { ipcRenderer } = require("electron");
```

<glue42 name="addClass" class="newFeatures" element="p" text="New Features">

- Workspace containers ([`Box`](../../../reference/glue/latest/workspaces/index.html#Box), [`Column`](../../../reference/glue/latest/workspaces/index.html#Column), [`Row`](../../../reference/glue/latest/workspaces/index.html#Row), [`Group`](../../../reference/glue/latest/workspaces/index.html#Group), [`WorkspaceWindow`](../../../reference/glue/latest/workspaces/index.html#WorkspaceWindow)) can now be [maximized and restored](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/workspaces/javascript/index.html#workspace-manipulating_workspace_elements-maximize_and_restore) programmatically within the bounds of the Workspace through the `maximize()` and `restore()` methods of their instances.

- Added a `<MoveArea />` component to the [`@glue42/workspaces-ui-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@glue42/workspaces-ui-react) library that can be used to relocate the Workspaces App [move area](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/workspaces/overview/index.html#extending_workspaces-header_area_components-move_area).

- [Preload scripts](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-platform-features/index.html#preload_scripts) can now be specified through the [application configuration](../../../developers/configuration/application/index.html) file. The preload scripts will be executed before the actual web app is loaded. Use the `"preloadScripts"` array of the `"details"` top-level key in the application configuration file, provide URLs to the scripts, and they will be executed in the specified order:

```json
"details": {
    ...
    "preloadScripts": [
        "https://my-domain.com/my-script.js",
        "https://my-domain.com/my-script.js"
    ]
}
```

- Added a [`download()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/windows/index.html#GDWindow-download) method to the Glue42 Window instance for [downloading files](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/window-management/javascript/index.html#window_operations-download):

```javascript
const url = "https://example.com/logo.png";
const options = {
    autoOpenDownload: true,
    // The file extension is taken from the downloaded file.
    name: "my-logo"
};

const { path, size, url } = await myWindow.download(url, options);

console.log(`Download path: ${path}, File size: ${size}, URL: ${url}`);
```

- Added an [`onDisplayChanged()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/displays/index.html#API-onDisplayChanged) method to the [Displays API](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-platform-features/index.html#displays) for capturing the [event that fires when a display has been modified](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-platform-features/index.html#displays-displays_api-events):

```javascript
const handler = (displays) => {
    // React to DPI changes, display connected or disconnected, monitor position changed, etc.
    console.log(displays);
};

glue.displays.onDisplayChanged(handler);
```

- Added a predefined app which [opens a URL in the default browser](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-platform-features/index.html#opening_urls_in_the_default_browser).

- It is now possible to allow applications to [access OS information](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-platform-features/index.html#accessing_os_info) (list of running processes, OS version, Glue42 start time) through their [application configuration](../../../developers/configuration/application/index.html). Set the `"allowOSInfo"` property to `true` in the `"details"` top-level key to allow an app to access OS information:

```json
"details": {
    ...
    "allowOSInfo": true
}
```

- Added a new command to the [Glue42 Server](../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-server/index.html) for stopping applications in a user session.
