## Overview

The Fidessa Tracking Groups are mapped via configuration to the [Glue42 Channels](../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/channels/overview/index.html) which allows passing context between Fidessa apps and Glue42 enabled apps.

Below is an example configuration of a Glue42 Channel which shows that the "Red" Glue42 Channel is mapped to Fidessa Tracking Group 5.

```json
{
    "name": "Red",
    "meta": {
        "color": "red",
        "fidessaGroup": {
            "index": 5,
            "readDataFieldPath": "",
            "writeDataFieldPath": ""
        }
    }
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `"index"` | `number` | The index of the Fidessa Tracking Group which to map to the respective Glue42 Channel. |
| `"readDataFieldPath"` | `string` | Specifies the field path to the Glue42 Channel data from where the Fidessa Connector reads the updated Channel value and then updates the Fidessa Tracking Group context. |
| `"writeDataFieldPath"` | `string` | Specifies the field path to the Glue42 Channel data where the Fidessa Connector writes the updated Fidessa Tracking Group context. |

The mapping between the Glue42 Channels and the Fidessa Tracking Groups is preconfigured (in the `channels.json` file located in the `%localappdata%\Tick42\GlueDesktop\config` folder), but you can decide to assign different Fidessa Tracking Groups to different Glue42 Channels. For more information on configuring the Glue42 Channels, see the [Developers](../../../developers/configuration/channels/index.html) section.

## Context Shape

The context passed from the Fidessa Connector to the Glue42 enabled apps and vice versa has the following shape:

```typescript
{
    instrument: {
        // "VOD.L" or { fim: "VOD.L", bloomberg: "VOD:LN", ... }
        id: string | object;
        [prop: string] : any
    },
    client: string | object,
    order: {
        fidessaReference: string
    }
}
```

## Handling Channel Context

On how to update and subscribe for changes to a Channel context, see the [Glue42 Channels API](../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/channels/javascript/index.html)

## Channel Updates

A Channel is updated every time the user selects an instrument, order or counterparty in a Fidessa app or in a Glue42 enabled app.

When an update from a Fidessa app arrives, the mapping service handles the conversion of instrument codes from FIM (Fidessa Instrument Mnemonic) to other standards (Bloomberg, Reuters Instrument Code, etc.). For instance, when a Fidessa app returns `"VOD.L"`, the connector translates that mnemonic to other standards as well and updates the context object accordingly:

```javascript
{
    instrument: {
        id: {
            bloomberg: "VOD:LN",
            fim: "VOD.L",
            ric: "VOD.L"
        }
    }
}
```

If there is no active mapping service, the value for the `instrument.id` property is the string literal received from Fidessa:

```javascript
{
    instrument: {
        id: "VOD.L"
    }
}
```

When a Glue42 enabled app updates the Channel context, the Fidessa Connector first tries to retrieve the instrument ID from the configured `"fimPath"` (see [Connection Settings](../connection/index.html#settings)) and if no instrument ID is available there, the value of the `instrument.id` property is sent to the mapping service. If no mapping service is available, or if the mapping service returns an object which doesn't contain an `instrument.id.fim` property, the update is ignored.
