## Restart and Shutdown

The App Management API is accessible through the [`glue.appManager`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html) object.

*See the JavaScript [App Management example](https://github.com/Glue42/js-examples/tree/master/app-management) on GitHub.*

To restart [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/), use the [`restart()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API-restart) method. This will close all running apps and their instances and then restart [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/):

```javascript
await glue.appManager.restart();
```

To shut down [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/), use the [`exit()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API-exit) method. This will close all running apps and their instances:

```javascript
await glue.appManager.exit();
```

*For details on how to execute custom code before restart or shutdown and also how to prevent restart or shutdown, see the [Events > Shutdown](#events-shutdown) section.*

## Managing App Definitions at Runtime

<glue42 name="addClass" class="colorSection" element="p" text="Available since Glue42 Enterprise 3.12">

App definitions can be imported, exported and removed at runtime using the [`InMemoryStore`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#InMemoryStore) object of the App Management API.

*Note that all app [`Definition`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#Definition) objects provided at runtime are stored in-memory and the methods of the `InMemoryStore` object operate only on them - i.e., the app definitions provided to [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) through local or remote configuration files aren't affected.*

### Import

To import a list of app definitions at runtime, use the [`import()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#InMemoryStore-import) method:

```javascript
const definitions = [
    {
        name: "my-app",
        type: "window",
        title: "My App",
        details: {
            url: "https://my-domain.com/my-app"
        }
    },
    {
        name: "my-other-app",
        type: "window",
        title: "My Other App",
        details: {
            url: "https://my-domain.com/my-other-app"
        }
    }
];
const mode = "merge";

const importResult = await glue.appManager.inMemory.import(definitions, mode);
```

The `import()` method accepts a list of [`Definition`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#Definition) objects as a first parameter and an import mode as a second. There are two import modes - `"replace"` (default) and `"merge"`. Using `"replace"` will replace all existing in-memory definitions with the provided ones, while using `"merge"` will merge the existing ones with the provided ones, replacing the app definitions with the same name. Use the `imported` property of the returned [`ImportResult`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#ImportResult) object to see a list of the successfully imported definitions and its `errors` property to see a list of the errors:

```javascript
const importedApps = importResult.imported;
const errors = importResult.errors;

importedApps.forEach(console.log);
errors.forEach(e => console.log(`App: ${e.app}, Error: ${e.error}`));
```

### Export

To export a list of already imported in-memory app definitions, use the [`export()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#InMemoryStore-export) method:

```javascript
const definitions = await glue.appManager.inMemory.export();
```

### Remove

To remove a specific in-memory app definition, use the [`remove()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#InMemoryStore-remove) method and provide the app name:

```javascript
await glue.appManager.inMemory.remove("my-app");
```

### Clear

To clear all imported in-memory definitions, use the [`clear()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#InMemoryStore-clear) method:

```javascript
await glue.appManager.inMemory.clear();
```

## Listing Apps

To see a list of all apps available to the current user, use the [`applications()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API-applications) method:

```javascript
const apps = glue.appManager.applications();
```

### Specific App

To get a reference to a specific app, use the [`application()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API-application) method and pass the name of the app as an argument:

```javascript
const app = glue.appManager.application("ClientList");
```

### Current App Instance

To get a reference to the instance of the current app, use the [`myInstance`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API-myInstance) property:

```javascript
const myInstance = glue.appManager.myInstance;
```

## Starting Apps

To start an app, use the [`start()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#Application-start) method of the app object:

```javascript
const app = glue.appManager.application("ClientList");

const appInstance = await app.start();
```

The `start()` method accepts two optional parameters - a context object (object in which you can pass custom data to your app) and an [`ApplicationStartOptions`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#ApplicationStartOptions) object.

The following example demonstrates how to start an app with context, enable the Glue42 [Channels](../../data-sharing-between-apps/channels/overview/index.html) for it and join it to a specific Channel:

```javascript
const app = glue.appManager.application("ClientList");
const context = { selectedUser: 2 };
const startOptions = { allowChannels: true, channelId: "Red" };

const appInstance = await app.start(context, startOptions);
```

*Note that all app options available under the `"details"` top level key of the [app configuration](../../../developers/configuration/application/index.html) can be passed as properties of the [`ApplicationStartOptions`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#ApplicationStartOptions) object. For more details on the available app configuration options, see the definition for the `"window"` app type under the `"details"` top-level of the [app configuration schema](../../../assets/configuration/application.json).*

## Listing Running Instances

To list all running instances of all apps, use the [`instances()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API-instances) method:

```javascript
// Returns a collection of the running instances of all apps.
glue.appManager.instances();
```

## Stopping Instances

To stop a running instance, use the [`stop()`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#Instance-stop) method of an instance object:

```javascript
await appInstance.stop();
```

## Events

### Shutdown

<glue42 name="addClass" class="colorSection" element="p" text="Available since Glue42 Enterprise 3.11">

The shutdown event provided by the App Management API allows you to execute custom code before [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) shuts down. The available time for the execution of your code is 60 seconds. The callback you provide for handling the event will receive a [`ShuttingDownEventArgs`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#ShuttingDownEventArgs) object as an argument. Use its `restarting` property to determine whether [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) is restarting or is shutting down:

```javascript
// The async code in the handler will be awaited up to 60 seconds
// before Glue42 Enterprise shuts down.
const handler = async (args) => {
    const isRestarting = args.restarting;

    if (isRestarting) {
        console.log("Restarting...");
    } else {
        await handleShutdown();
    };
};

glue.appManager.onShuttingDown(handler);
```

To prevent shutdown or restart of [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/), the async handler must resolve with an object with a `prevent` property set to `true`:

```javascript
const handler = async () => { return { prevent: true } };

glue.appManager.onShuttingDown(handler);
```

### App

The set of apps defined for the current user can be changed at runtime. To track the events which fire when an app has been added, removed or updated, use the respective methods exposed by the App Management API.

App added event:

```javascript
const handler = app => console.log(app.name);

// Notifies you when an app has been added.
const unsubscribe = glue.appManager.onAppAdded(handler);
```

App removed event:

```javascript
const handler = app => console.log(app.name);

// Notifies you when an app has been removed.
const unsubscribe = glue.appManager.onAppRemoved(handler);
```

App updated event:

```javascript
const handler = app => console.log(app.name);

// Notifies you when an app configuration has been updated.
const unsubscribe = glue.appManager.onAppChanged(handler);
```

### Instance

To monitor instance related events globally (for all instances of all apps running in [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/)) or on an app level (only instances of a specific app), use the respective methods exposed by the App Management API.

#### Global

The [`appManager`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#API) object offers methods which you can use to monitor instance events for all apps running in [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/). Get notified when an app instance has started, stopped, has been updated or when starting an app instance has failed. The methods for handling instance events receive a callback as a parameter which in turn receives the app instance as an argument. All methods return an unsubscribe function - use it to stop receiving notifications about instance events.

Instance started event:

```javascript
const handler = instance => console.log(instance.id);

const unsubscribe = glue.appManager.onInstanceStarted(handler);
```

Instance stopped event:

```javascript
const handler = instance => console.log(instance.id);

const unsubscribe = glue.appManager.onInstanceStopped(handler);
```

Instance updated event:

```javascript
const handler = instance => console.log(instance.id);

const unsubscribe = glue.appManager.onInstanceUpdated(handler);
```

#### App Level

To monitor instance events on an app level, use the methods offered by the [`Application`](../../../reference/glue/latest/appmanager/index.html#Application) object. The methods for handling instance events receive a callback as a parameter which in turn receives the app instance as an argument.

Instance started event:

```javascript
const app = glue.appManager.application("ClientList");
const handler = instance => console.log(instance.id);

app.onInstanceStarted(handler);
```

Instance stopped event:

```javascript
const app = glue.appManager.application("ClientList");
const handler = instance => console.log(instance.id);

app.onInstanceStopped(handler);
```
