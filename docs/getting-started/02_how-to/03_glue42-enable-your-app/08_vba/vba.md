## Overview

The Glue42 COM library allows you to Glue42 enable your MS Office VBA apps and integrate them with other Glue42 enabled apps in [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/). You can use Glue42 functionality in your VBA apps for Excel, Outlook, Word, etc. The Glue42 COM library support the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of MS Office 2013 and up.

To access Glue42 functionalities in your VBA app, you have to reference and initialize the Glue42 COM library. The Glue42 COM library is distributed as a DLL file which is a part of the SDK bundle of [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) located in the `%LocalAppData%\Tick42\GlueSDK\GlueCOM` folder.

In the [Glue42 VBA Concepts](#glue42_vba_concepts) section below you will find general concepts that apply when using the Glue42 COM library in VBA. The [COM/VBA Reference](#comvba_reference) section provides reference documentation specific to using the Glue42 COM library in VBA apps.

## Using the Glue42 COM Library

### Referencing

The [Glue42 COM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GlueCOM/) library is available as a package in NuGet which you can include in your projects. The Glue42 COM library is also distributed with [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) and is usually located in the `%LocalAppData%\Tick42\GlueSDK\GlueCOMv2` folder.

To reference the Glue42 COM library, open the Microsoft VBA Editor and go to `Tools > References`. Click "Browse" find and select the `GlueCOM.dll` file. In the list of available references you should now see "Tick42 Glue for COM":

![Reference](../../../../images/com/reference.png)

### Initialization

To initialize the Glue42 COM library, import the library and create an instance of the `Glue42` class. You can use this instance to access all Glue42 functionality. Finally, register your app.

Below is an example of a subroutine which initializes Glue42, exposing the app instance under the name "My VBA App":

```vbnet
Dim Glue As Glue42

Public Sub InitializeGlue()
    If Glue Is Nothing Then
        Set Glue = New Glue42
        ' Connecting to Glue42 and registering the app instance.
        Glue.StartWithAppName ("My VBA App")
    End If
End Sub
```

## Glue42 VBA Concepts

Once the Glue42 COM library has been initialized, your app has access to all Glue42 functionalities. For more detailed information on the different Glue42 concepts and APIs, see:

- [Shared Contexts](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/shared-contexts/vba/index.html)
- [Channels](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/channels/vba/index.html)
- [Interop](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/interop/vba/index.html)
- [Window Management](../../../../glue42-concepts/windows/window-management/vba/index.html)

The following sections explain concepts related to using the Glue42 COM library.

### Composite Values

All Glue42 functionality related to receiving and sending data works with composite data values (structures). The Glue42 COM library for VBA provides a mechanism based on the [`GlueDynamicValue`](#classes-gluedynamicvalue) class to dynamically build composite values and to access individual fields within the composite structure.

#### Building Composite Values

- use [`CreateGlueValues`](#classes-glue42-creategluevalues) to get an empty dynamic value representing the root of the composite data structure;
- use chained indexing to set individual fields within the data structure (see [Indexing](#glue42_vba_concepts-composite_values-indexing));

The following shows how to build a sample composite value which can be used as an argument when [invoking an Interop method](../../../../glue42-concepts/data-sharing-between-apps/interop/vba/index.html#method_invocation):

```vbnet
' Creating an empty root value.
Dim MyVal
Set MyVal = Glue.CreateGlueValues

' Setting a field with a string value.
MyVal("operation") = "AddSub"

' Setting a field with an array of integers as a value.
Dim OperandsArray(0 To 1) As Integer
OperandsArray(0) = 5
OperandsArray(1) = 3
MyVal("operands") = OperandsArray

' Setting a string field nested in another composite value.
MyVal("metadata")("reason") = "testing"
```

As a result, `MyVal` will contain the following composite value (represented as a JSON object):

```json
{
    "operation": "AddSub",
    "operands": [5, 3],
    "metadata": {
        "reason": "testing"
    }
}
```

#### Indexing

You can use named indexing with instances of [`GlueDynamicValue`](#classes-gluedynamicvalue) to access child nodes by name.

For example:

```vbnet
Dim MyValue
MyValue = DynamicValue("ChildNodeName")
```

Depending on whether `"ChildNodeName"` exists and its type, the return value from the named indexing can be:

- `Variant`/[`GlueDynamicValue`](#classes-gluedynamicvalue) if `"ChildNodeName"` represents a composite value. If `"ChildNodeName"` doesn't exist, it will be automatically created as an empty composite value.
- `Variant`/`<some native type>` if `"ChildNodeName"` represents an elementary field.

As indexing can return another instance of `GlueDynamicValue`, this allows for chained indexing to access nested composite values:

```vbnet
Dim MyDoubleValue as Double
MyDoubleValue = DynamicValue("CompositeLevel_0")("CompositeLevel_1")("ElementaryDoubleField")
```

*Note that using indexing is recommended only when accessing fields within a composite value with a known structure.*

#### Accessing Composite Value Fields

- use the `GetReflectData` method of a data provider instance passing an empty string as an argument to get the root of the composite value;
- the data provider is typically passed as an argument to callback/event handler subroutines which are invoked when Glue42 sends data to the app;

The example below uses the same data structure from the previous example and shows how to access fields in a composite value. The `invocationRequest` data provider is passed as an argument to the handler subroutine:

```vbnet
' Declaring the native variables.
Dim Operation As String
Dim Operand1, Operand2 As Integer
Dim Reason As String
Dim Error As Integer

' Getting the root of the composite value from the data provider.
Dim Args
Set Args = invocationRequest.GetReflectData("")

' Extracting the elementary fields from the composite value:

' Accessing a string value.
Operation = Args("operation")
' Accessing integer values in an array.
Operand1 = Args("operands")(0)
Operand2 = Args("operands")(1)
' Access a string value inside a composite value.
Reason = Args("metadata")("reason")
' This will raise a "Type Mismatch" exception: "metadata" is a composite value which can't be cast to "Integer".
Error = Args("metadata")
```
Elementary fields are automatically cast to the compatible native type. Trying to assign to an incompatible type will raise an exception. Array elements can be accessed by their numeric index. Arrays can't be directly cast to a native array type. Accessing a field which doesn't exist will return an empty [GlueDynamicValue](#classes-gluedynamicvalue).

You can also store a lower-level composite value or array in a temporary variable and use it to access its fields. This helps avoid unnecessary repetitions of the path to deeper nested composite values and extra calls to the Glue42 COM library:

```vbnet
Dim OperArr
' Storing an array from a composite data structure in a variable.
OperArr = Args("operands")
' Accessing array elements from the temporary variable.
Operand1 = OperArr(0)
Operand2 = OperArr(1)
```

Another possibility for accessing a lower-level value in a composite structure directly from the data provider is to specify a path to the value when invoking `GetReflectData`. This can be useful when handling complex composite values where only part of the value structure is of interest:

```vbnet
' Accessing directly a lower-level value by providing a path as an argument.
Reason = invocationRequest.GetReflectData("metadata.reason")
```

#### Traversing Composite Values with Unknown or Dynamic Structure

To traverse and get information about the fields of a composite value with unknown or dynamic structure, use the `Count`, `Names` and `Values` properties of a [`GlueDynamicValue`](#classes-gluedynamicvalue) instance and its [`Contains`](#classes-gluedynamicvalue-contains) method.

### Glue42 Time

Glue42 time is essentially a Unix timestamp: the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch, i.e. `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`, ignoring leap seconds. To convert from Glue42 time to VBA `Date`, you can use the following formula:

```vbnet
VBADate = CDate(GlueTime / 86400 + 25569)
```

- `86400` is the number of seconds in one day (60 * 60 * 24);
- `25569` is the VBA numeric representation of `1970-01-01 00:00:00`;

Note that the resulting `Date` timestamp will also be in UTC, and not in local time.

### Helper Functions

The VBA samples use a helper function which simplifies the use of the Glue42 COM library and/or provides functionality not directly available in VBA.

#### GetFormHwnd

This helper function is used to retrieve the window handle (HWND) of a VBA `UserForm`.

Implementation:

```vbnet
Private Declare PtrSafe Function FindWindowA _
    Lib "user32.dll" ( _
    ByVal lpClassName As String, _
    ByVal lpWindowName As String) As LongPtr

Public Function GetFormHwnd(Form As Variant) As Long
    Dim strCaption As String
    Dim strClass As String

    ' Class name changed in Office 2000.
    If Val(Application.Version) >= 9 Then
        strClass = "ThunderDFrame"
    Else
        strClass = "ThunderXFrame"
    End If

    Randomize
    ' Saving the caption.
    strCaption = Form.Caption
    Form.Caption = "FindMe#" + CStr(Rnd)

    GetFormHwnd = CLng(FindWindowA(strClass, Form.Caption))
    'Restoring the caption.
    Form.Caption = strCaption
End Function
```
