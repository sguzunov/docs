> ### Opening and Saving Layouts from Earlier Glue42 Versions
>
> [Layouts](../../../glue42-concepts/windows/layouts/overview/index.html) created with Glue42 3.10 or earlier can be opened in Glue42 3.11, however, once saved in Glue42 3.11, they can't be opened in Glue42 3.10 or earlier. It is strongly recommended that you don't point Glue42 3.10 or earlier and Glue42 3.11 to the same Layout stores.
