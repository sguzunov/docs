## Quick Guide

To Glue42 enable your app, you need to do 3 things:

- reference the respective Glue42 library (JavaScript, .NET, Java, etc.);
- initialize the Glue42 library;
- create an app definition and add it to the [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) configurations folder;

The following is an example of configuring a simple web app. Create your own basic web app or use this [JavaScript test app skeleton](../../../../assets/js-test-app.zip) and follow the steps in the guide below to test in practice how to Glue42 enable an app and add it to the [Glue42 Toolbar](../../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-toolbar/index.html). If you choose to use the provided test app skeleton, see the README file for instructions on how to run it.

*See also how to reference and initialize Glue42 in a [.NET](../net/index.html), [Java](../java/index.html), [React](../react/index.html), [Angular](../angular/index.html), [Node.js](../nodejs/index.html), [VBA](../vba/index.html), [Delphi](../delphi/index.html) or [Dash](../dash/index.html) environment.*

1. Reference the Glue42 library file in a `<script>` tag. If you are using the example app skeleton provided above, the Glue42 library file is is named `desktop.umd.js`:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="desktop.umd.js"></script>
```

2. Initialize the Glue42 library.

To initialize the Glue42 library, place this code snippet in a `<script>` tag directly in the `index.html` or in the `index.js` file (which you have to reference in your `index.html`):

```javascript
const init = async () => {
    window.glue = await Glue();
};

init().catch(console.error);
```

Your `index.html` should now look something like this:

```html
<body>
    <h1>My Test App</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Some Data
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript" src="desktop.umd.js"></script>
<script>
    const init = async () => {
        window.glue = await Glue();
        console.log(`Glue42 initialized successfully!\nGlue42 version: ${glue.version}`);
    };

    init().catch(console.error);
</script>
```

3. Create an app definition.

To add your app to the [Glue42 Toolbar](../../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-toolbar/index.html), you must create a JSON file with app configuration. Place this file in the `%LocalAppData%\Tick42\UserData\<ENV>-<REG>\apps` folder, where `<ENV>-<REG>` must be replaced with the environment and region of your [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) copy (e.g., `T42-DEMO`). If you are using the provided test app, you can simply copy the provided `js-test-app.json` configuration file to that location. Otherwise, see below how to create a quick and simple app definition:

```json
{
    "name": "test-app",
    "title": "My Test App",
    "type": "window",
    "details": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3333/index.html",
        "mode": "tab",
        "width": 500,
        "height": 400
    }
}
```

The `"name"`, `"type"`, `"details"` and `"url"` properties are required.

4. Start your app.

Now you can start your app from the [Glue42 Toolbar](../../../../glue42-concepts/glue42-toolbar/index.html). You can open the console of the app window by pressing `F12` to see the printed successful initialization message. You can also start exploring the Glue42 APIs by accessing the `glue` object that was attached to the global `window` object during initialization.

That's it! You now have your first Glue42 enabled app!
